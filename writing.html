    <em>“What reflexivity does, what it threatens to expose, what it reveals and who it 
        empowers depends upon who does it and how they go about it.”</em> <sup>1</sup> <br><br>
        In this essay, I will compare the representation of nude racialized women by two artists and the ways in which the artists remade 19th century canonical European works. The two paintings, <em>Women of Algiers</em>  by Picasso, and <em>Sleep: Deux Femmes Noires</em> by Mickalene Thomas, present a diverging approach to representing the female nude and race through the lens of European art history. I chose the two works because of their similarities in cubist, collage inspired form, bright colors, and subject matter. Yet, their differences intrigued me the most, as both present European art conventions in drastically different ways.  <br><br>
        I analyze, compare, and contrast the works through an anti-colonial feminist lens, utilizing frameworks such as reflexivity, subject vs object, and Orientalism. I argue that Picasso’s <em>Women of Algiers</em> is only reflexive and radical in form, not in content. In contrast, Thomas’s <em>Sleep: Deux Femmes Noires</em>, is truly, holistically reflexive - challenging and subverting western hegemonic art conventions in both form and content. This totalizing approach to reflexivity, I argue, has radical potential for making the unconscious, mystified, or unknown visible. <br><br>
        The subjects of <em>Sleep: Deux Femmes Noires</em> by Mickalene Thomas are two Black women sleeping alongside one another. The two women, centered in the composition, are surrounded by a scene of nature and water, created by collaged photos and implied textures, faceted over one another. Thomas incorporates the influences of French impressionism, seen with the imagery of plants, water, and sky, as well as European modernism and Pop Art.<sup>2</sup> The work is large: 38 1/2 × 
        80 1/2 in. The size is reminiscent of history paintings, which demand attention and declare significance with their grandiosity.  <br><br>
        <em>Sleep</em> is based on <em>Les Sommeil (The Sleep/The Sleepers)</em> by Gustave Courbet, but Thomas departs from her inspiration in many ways. Sleep is predominantly composed utilizing a triadic color scheme of blues, oranges, and greens. Rather than the subject as two white women laying together inside, as with <em>Les Sommeil</em>, Thomas’ subjects are Black women outside. Furthermore, Thomas’ painting rejects the realism of <em>Les Sommeil</em> and evokes a Cubist aesthetic. The forms of the work are made of facets of texture and color, as if the subject has been deconstructed and collaged back together by Thomas.  <br><br>
        <em>Women of Algiers</em> by Pablo Picasso is more explosive with its color, texture, and fragmentation of its subjects. The work by Picasso is one of 15 variations he produced between 1954-1955 as Algeria was rebelling against French colonial rule. <em>Women of Algiers</em> is inspired by the painting <em>Women of Algiers in their Apartment</em> by Eugene Delacroix – painted at the beginning of French colonial rule in Algeria. Picasso’s version differs starkly from the original. While portraying the same subject as the original – Algerian women in a harem – Picasso completely transforms the visual representation and form of the work.  <br><br>
        Aside from the woman on the left, the women are fragmented, separated, nude, and faceless. The figures’ sexuality and eroticism are emphasized by Picasso. The entire right side of the composition is chaos, filled with bending, volumetric body parts and striped facets, appearing stair-like in certain areas. The left side is more comprehensible. It is dominated by a towering woman wearing decorative clothing and an elaborate hat or veil with her breasts exposed. The painting features bright greens, blues, yellows, and red-orange hues. The space is compressed in comparison to Delacroix’s version, creating a claustrophobic environment.<sup>3</sup> <br><br>
        In looking at the two pieces side by side, there are immediate similarities. Both portray nude women. Both paintings are composed of fragmented facets of color and texture, utilizing the logic of cubism. They both even utilize similar color palettes of orange-red, blue, and green hues. Both <em>Sleep: Deux Femmes Noires</em> and <em>Women of Algiers</em> are explicit references and modern interpretations of 19th century canonical European paintings. In addition to these similarities, I argue that both works are reflexive in form in their reinterpretations of historic paintings.   <br><br>
        But upon careful inspection, acute differences are significant to understanding the two works. Firstly, while they both evoke cubism, <em>Sleep</em> represents more of a synthetic cubist approach in its use of implied textures to signify an object. <em>Women of Algiers</em> is more closely aligned to the works of early cubism in its volumetric representations of women. The space appears expansive and endless in <em>Sleep</em>, whereas <em>Women of Algiers</em> appears as a contained spiral turning in on itself. More importantly, while they are both reflexive in form – subverting the conventions and norms of canonical work of the 19th century to make them apparent – only Thomas’s <em>Sleep</em> is reflexive in both form <em>and</em> content.  <br><br>
        What do I mean by this? First, I will explain how both artists are reflexive in how they explore form in their works. For Picasso and Braque, their understanding and unveiling of the conventions of the classical tradition – iconography, draftsmanship, space and time, and illusionism – were undone, changed, and subverted through Cubism. They followed the classical tradition of western art in their subject matter but subverted it in their radical experimentation in form.<sup>4</sup> <em>Women in Algiers</em> continues this legacy as Picasso keeps the subject matter, women in a harem, the same as the traditional painting he is referencing, but radically changes the form.  <br><br>
        For Thomas, her understanding and unveiling of the conventions of the classical tradition operate in a very similar way. She keeps the subject matter, two women/lovers sleeping, the same, but radically changes the form into a fractured, modern, bright, and intimate scene. For Picasso, the subversion stops here. He does not reinterpret the subjects, the Algerian women, in any radical direction, other than painting the women nude, more sexualized, and more irrational than the original painting by Delacroix. This is disappointing, as Picasso, at the least, had ample inspiration from women freedom fighters during the period <em>Women in Algiers</em> was painted – the  Algerian War of Independence.  <br><br>
        In contrast, Thomas demonstrates her knowledge of the conventions of content and acceptability in canonical European art through reflexive representation, as the female nude was not a space for the sensuality and intimacy of Black women to be explored whatsoever in 19th century Europe. She makes several key changes from the original painting. With this analysis in mind, I argue that the main differences, the essence and content of the paintings, are oppositional to one another. Picasso’s work <em>reinforces</em> the misogynistic, orientalist content of European art while subverting its form, while Thomas’s work <em>critiques</em> the white supremacist, heteronormative, and patriarchal content of European art while subverting its form. <br><br>
        I will explore how the essences of these paintings differ by analyzing their representation of nudity and their representation of racialized women. I will explore how Thomas subverts the conventions of European painting through her radical use of nakedness and racialized women. On the other hand, I will explore how Picasso further reproduces the misogyny and Orientalism through his nude figures and colonial imagination. As Picasso and Thomas take radically different approaches in how they represent women, they represent unconscious continuation (at best) and radical reflexivity of the content of European conventions, respectively.  <br><br>
        Firstly, the representation of nudity differs between the works. This difference can be summarized as the difference between nudity and nakedness. John Berger, cultural critic and art historian, states that “[t]o be naked is to be oneself. To be nude is to be seen naked by others and yet not recognized for oneself… Nakedness reveals itself. Nudity is placed on display.”<sup>5</sup>  This difference between nudity and nakedness can also be understood as the difference between subject and object.  <br><br>
        Thomas seeks to blur the distinction between subject and object throughout her works, exemplified in <em>Sleep</em>. The sleeping women are naked, but they are not sexualized in the way that traditional nude paintings are. In the place of sexualization and objectification of the women, instead, are intimacy and subjectivity. The women reveal themselves for who they are, their authentic selves, and their desire for one another. The sleeping women are engaging in homosexual intimacy for one another, rather than a male spectator. Interestingly, Thomas chooses to place her subjects outside on blankets where the original depicted the women laying indoors. In doing so, she takes her subjects from the realm of the private, to the realm of the public, of the political. <br><br>
        In contrast, Picasso further objectifies the subjects compared to Delacroix’s <em>Women of Algiers in their Apartment</em>, placing the women on display. All the women in Picasso’s version are fully or partially nude in various poses. The women are not shown for who they are – three of the four do not even have faces. Instead, their nude bodies are reclining or posing with arms over their head as a spectacle. One of the women’s bodies is violently contorted, showing both breasts and buttocks, achieving impossible form to maximize view of her body. While Thomas transforms Courbet’s two women from private to public realms, illustrating that the personal is political, Picasso further transforms Delacroix’s women in their private space into sexualized objects for public display. If Delacroix’s painting represents “the conquest of Algeria by entering the Algerian home,”<sup>6</sup> Picasso’s remake represents the added colonization of the women’s bodies, not just their land.  <br><br>
        In addition to nudity, analyzing the representation of race in both portraits is useful in further exploring radical reflexivity and unconscious continuation of oppressive European conventions. I will explore the conventions of the 18th-20th centuries in Europe regarding Black sexuality and orientalist depictions of women in art. I will then use these conventions to argue Thomas’s subversion and Picasso’s continuation of them. <br><br>
        Thomas’s representation of Black women in <em>Sleep: Deux Femmes Noires</em> is antithetical to any representation of Black women in the 19th century, when <em>Les Sommeil</em>, the painting she references, by Courbet was painted. In 19th century Europe, Black women were mostly portrayed in nude portraits alongside white women, such as in <em>Olympia</em> by Manet. In Manet’s work, the Black woman is a fully clothed servant assisting the nude, white middle class prostitute, Olympia. Black servants were used throughout the 18th and 19th centuries by artists to “mark illicit sexual activity,”<sup>7</sup> as white supremacist ideologies rendered Black people as sexually   deviant and hypersexual. This violent ideology permeated legal structures, scientific thinking, and hegemonic common sense of the time.  <br><br>
        When Black women were shown naked, it was in the context of rendering them hypersexual or exoticizing them. <em>The Servant</em> (1890) by Franz von Bayros is an example of how the caricaturized, explicit sexuality of Black people was used to construct a passive, covert sexuality for white women. The painting depicts hypersexualized Black child alongside a white woman, covering her nude chest. Outside of art, the nude bodies of Black women were put on display to showcase how “primitive” they were, closer to animals than white women. One such example is of the exhibition of an indentured Black woman, Saartjie Baartman, or the “Hottentot Venus.” Baartman’s sexual organs were pathologized and displayed to the European public.<sup>8</sup> <br><br>
        <em>Sleep: Deux Femmes Noires</em> by Thomas subverts these norms entirely. Her representation of Black women is one of love and safety, as the two women curl into one another. The outside world is not against them, it acts as a scene allowing and witnessing their intimacy with calmness. Thomas’s work demonstrates that in progressive and totalizing contexts - that is in both form and content - “reflexivity [can be used] to '... destroy the myths that cloak the exercise of power and the perpetuation of domination.'”<sup>9</sup>  <br><br>
        While both anti-Blackness and Orientalism are both white supremacist ideologies with shared histories of colonialism and slavery, Orientalism differs from anti-Black ideology. Orientalist depictions of women render them passive sexual objects. Their sexuality, while passive, is also excessive. Imaginings of the “Orient” are filled with riches, luxury, ornamentation, and willing servants for western men to take advantage of.<sup>10</sup> The erotic and exotic are the main threads defining Orientalist depictions of women.  <br><br>
        Picasso’s <em>Women of Algiers</em> completely embraces the Orientalist art of the past. Within the work, Picasso’s Orientalism partially lies in his overt sexualization of colonized women, which is part and parcel of colonial, or Orientalist, ideologies. But most importantly, his interpretation of <em>Women of Algiers</em> is pure fiction. One of the key understandings of Orientalism is “that 'the Orient' is a European invention.”<sup>11</sup> Not unlike the male gaze, the western gaze that defines Orientalism robs Western Asia and Northern Africa, or the “Middle East,” of its reality and replaces it with the imaginings of the west. This is true of Picasso, as he had never visited North Africa or Algeria. The western imagination and lure of the exotic “Orient,” popularized through paintings and postcards, such as <em>Women of Algiers in their Apartment</em> by Delacroix, fueled the subsequent colonization of Western Asia and Northern Africa.  <br><br>
        In further sexualizing a painting that served as colonial inspiration, Picasso reinforces colonial conventions of European canonical art. The intensification of the women’s sexuality by  Picasso is not done as a means of criticism, as he did so out of admiration and personal pleasure. Picasso included references from the well-known Orientalist painter Ingres, as well as Matisse, and his own work, <em>Les Demoiselles d’Avignon</em>, in <em>Women of Algiers.</em><sup>12</sup> The work is filled with the conventions and history of Orientalism and misogyny from Europe, which he admired in the works of the other artists, as well as his own. Furthermore, he inserted his own sexual fantasies by using his “new love, Jacqueline Roque,”<sup>13</sup> as a model for the painting. Picasso, thus, utilizes the context of prostituted women in Algeria to imagine “his own personal harem of female forms.”<sup>14</sup> Picasso exhibits no reflexivity regarding the content of his painting, only embracing the past lineages of Orientalist paintings.  <br><br>
        In conclusion, where Thomas’s subjects perform the opposite of conventional expectations, Picasso’s subjects embody them. The stark difference between Mickalene Thomas’s <em>Sleep: Deux Femmes Noires</em> and Pablo Picasso’s <em>Women of Algiers</em> is a result of each artist’s subject position, limitations of their time, aspirations, and world outlook. These all inform an artist’s perspective on how they engage and represent a topic. It is the responsibility of educational and artistic institutions to embrace and promote outlooks of progressive and marginalized artists, such as Mickalene Thomas, as a means of pedagogy. Reflexive art can be a means for institutions to acknowledge the harms of and move beyond the European canon of art. While the reflexive innovations of form are often celebrated, as with the achievements of Cubism, I argue that the reflexive innovations of content should be taken just as seriously as form.
