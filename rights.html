        <h4 class="title">Know Your Rights</h4>
        <p>Know Your Rights explores the relationship between beauty and labor, and how aesthetic labor has been branded as fun rather than work. The installation and its parts evoke a liminal space between a bedroom and an office. 

            Posters proclaiming the right to self-expression and the right to be desirable replace typical workers' rights posters. The clock, used to measure how long a person performs labor tasks, has no numbers to do so. The video, mimicking workplace training videos, instructs the viewer to concern themselves with their looks, and to view the time, energy, and money that goes into beauty as fun, play, and self-expression. 
            
            The visuals of the project are inspired by hegemonic beauty qualities - pearly white, shiny, smooth, youthful – paired with red to evoke both labor and beauty. Research and inspiration around this project included Jessica De Fino’s Substack writings, the anthology "Aesthetic Labor: Rethinking Beauty Politics in Neoliberalism," and current beauty branding.</p>
