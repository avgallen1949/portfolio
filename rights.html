        This project is currently a WIP and undergoing a complete redesign and expansion. The installation will be on view in the Grunwald Gallery in mid-late April.
        <br><br>
          Despite the time, money, and specialized skills that go into the habitual upkeep or alteration of oneâ€™s appearance, aesthetic labor is societally unrecognized as a form of labor. Rather, aesthetic labor is mystified, particularly by the beauty industry, as a fun, easy, and expressive activity for women. Through satirical representation of this logic, I illuminate that the work of idealized beauty is a form of invisible labor that is unpaid and goes unrecognized.
