        <h4 class="title">Know Your Rights</h4>
        <p>The installation, exploring the under recognition of aesthetic labor as a form of labor, represents a liminal space between a bedroom and an office workspace. Decorative posters proclaiming the right to self-expression and the right to be desirable replace typical posters found in a workplace depicting workers’ rights. The clock, used to measure labor time, has no numbers to do so. Rather, it states "Time Flies When You're Having Fun," rendering the ability to track time spent performing aesthetic labor impossible. The video, mimicking a workplace training video, instructs the viewer to concern themselves with their looks, and to view the time, energy, and money that goes into aesthetic upkeep as fun, play, and self-expression. The visuals of the project are inspired by hegemonic beauty qualities - pearly white, shiny, smooth, youthful – paired with red to evoke both labor and beauty. Research and inspiration around this project included Jessica De Fino’s Substack writings, the anthology "Aesthetic Labor: Rethinking Beauty Politics in Neoliberalism," and current beauty branding and language.</p>
