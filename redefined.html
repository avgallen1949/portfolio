    <h4 class="title">Girlhood Redefined</h4>
    <p>Year-long self-initiated research, art, and design project in collaboration with the Kinsey Institute.  The project will culminate in an exhibition and book that showcase the multiplicity of girlhood. This will be done by interviewing as many people as I can to discuss adolescent girlhood (~range 15-21) and utilizing the conversations as source material for the book and exhibition.

        Here, girlhood is not limited to cis experiences of girlhood or requires one to currently identify as a girl or woman. Anyone who has experienced girlhood, in its many forms, is invited to participate. <br><br> If interested in participating, fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17Bh8hdrvT61s3EfK8SQ1AjMzggFJlGiXNGhjQFY6RBw/edit" target="_blank">this form.</a></p>
