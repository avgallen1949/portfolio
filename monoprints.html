    <h4 class="title">Letterpress Monoprints</h4>
    <p>Created for exchange project with my BFA classmates. The topic for the exchange was "structure," and students were tasked with interpreting that in any given direction and creating 14 gifts to give to our classmates and professor. <br><br>In mimicking the structure of a snowflake, which contains infinitely unique possibilities and is determined by the conditions of its surroundings, I created a series of monoprints. 
        Each print utilized the same inputs and was limited to a given form, but the outcome of each print was completely unique. I asked my classmates to give me one word that describes who they are at their core, and three things that have changed and impacted them. Considerations of color, texture, and mark-making were made in response to each of my classmates' answers.</p>
