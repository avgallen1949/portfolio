<!--Description-->
<p class="info">Artist Statement<br></p>
<p class="about">Avrie Allen (born 1997) is an artist and designer living and working in Bloomington, Indiana. She works earnestly, creating content-rich, and vibrant publications, videos, posters, digital graphics, web pages, and physical objects which foreground lively colors, forms, and typography. Avrie blurs the boundaries between art, design, and craft, making no distinction between them. Visually, she is inspired by ornamentation, pattern, and women’s material history. She allows the form of her works, whether digital, analog, or a combination of both, to be driven by content and research.

  <br><br>Avrie believes that art is never neutral. Her practice traverses the politics of feminism, labor, technology, art, and design, with content ranging from aesthetic labor to capitalist uses of artificial intelligence. At large, she is inspired by teenage girls, historical political movements, as well as the contemporary feminist, abolitionist, and anti-capitalist community organizations she has participated in and designed for since 2016. Avrie is always driven by her care for others and extends her practice beyond the studio, striving to engage, reflect, and cultivate community.
  
  <br><br>Currently, she is researching and creating work on how girls define girlhood, demystifying aesthetic (beauty) labor as a form of women’s work, and the creative potential of hand-coded webpages on the internet.
